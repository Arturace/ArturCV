               My name is Artur Madjidov. 
               <br/>
               I am currently a software developer.
               <br/>
               This static website is here to show you some technical info about me.

               <div hidden>
                  <p>
                     I get to practice <strong>JavaScript</strong> frontend web developpement on a daily basis.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     I used to mainly use jQuery because of how less verbose the syntax seemed comapred to vanilla JS, 
                     but with time I started to realize how powerfull vanilla JS is without the need of using jQuery.

               <div>HTML & CSS</div>
               <div hidden>
                  <p>
                     Alongside clientside JavaScript, I practice <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> daily (duh).
                     <br/> 
                     <br/>
                     I was lucky enough to be required to support legacy browsers during developpement of some projects. 
                     I consider this a major strength, because it makes you realize how little standard there was only a few years ago.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     At the moment I get to work with the latest features of HTML5 and CSS'3'(meaning the latest multi-browser supported css features).
                  </p>

               <div hidden>
                  <p>
                     C# is currently the primary programming language I use for applications' backend both at work and personally.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     I enjoy the surface use simplicity of the language (from the syntax, to the common use of core elements),
                     as well as how far you can push it (something I probably didn't even scratch the surface of).
                  </p>

               <div hidden>
                     <p>
                        I never had the opportunity to practice <strong>Java</strong> at work, but I did do a lot of it in College.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        It is often matched against C# - I personally prefer C# over <strong>Java</strong> - for a special reason. I highly dislike Java IDEs. <small>Some language quirks also suck, but I'm not efficient if my IDE is hot trash</small>

               <div hidden>
                  <p>
                     I'll be the first to admit - <strong>SQL</strong> in any form - is not my strongest suit.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     I do however have enough experience and knowledge to create and modify tables, sotred procedures, functions and triggers.

                        I'll be the first to admit - <strong>SQL</strong> in any form - is not my strongest suit.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I did however spent countless hours working with <strong>Oracle</strong> software in College. So I will definitly find my way

                  <p>
                     I feel comfortable with placing <strong>VB</strong> in this section, as I got to use it both at college and in supporting legacy applications at work.

               <div>PHP</div>
               <div hidden>
                  <p>
                     Event though <strong>PHP</strong> was the main language I had to use for web applications when I was in college, I had very little professional experience with the langugage.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Professionally, I used it for modifying some wordpress websites, as well as repairing some websites.

               <div>TypeScript</div>
               <div hidden>
                  <p>
                     I find TypeScript to be an excelent tool to make complex functionnalities with JS, 
                     as well as making you understand JS so much more.
                     I also believe that it is harmful on small scale frontend projects, as it only slows down the process from my little experiences.
                  </p>

               <div hidden>
                     <p>
                        Even though my second programming lesson in College was all about C++, I can confirm that I hardly recall the syntax, but do wish to master this language in the enxt few years.
                     </p>
                  </div>
            </li>
            <li>
               <div>PostScript</div>
               <div hidden>
                  <p>
                     While transforming a WinForms application from VB6 to C#, I had to over a process for generating a pretty massive <strong>PostScript</strong> file.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     I know the basics, can read it, but do not have enough experience to draw anything.
                     <br/>
                     I also believe that knowing to do that is becoming more unnecessary with time. So many more user/programmer friendly programms exist now, like the SSRS builder in Visual Studio.
